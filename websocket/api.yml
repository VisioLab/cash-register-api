    ### Enables communication between the VisioLab food scanner and a cash register

    The iPad running the VisioLab scanner runs a Websocket server in the local
    network on `ws:/<local-ip>/visiolab-cash-register`.


    Once the cash register has established a connection, it should synchronize
    its articles using the `syncItems` operation. Afterwards
    the scanner is ready to detect food.


    Once something is detected, `setBasket` will be send, followed by 
    `startPayment`. The cash register should handle the transaction and 
    "respond" by sending either `paymentSuccess` or `paymentFailure`.


    Each message contains an `event` and a `data` property at the top level. The `event`
    property identifies the type of the message, so that actions can be dispatched
    based on it. The `data` property contains the actual content of the message.
